So far, I have implemented all of the base class definiteion code except the crossover method. Working on the pico world again, I realized how many weird errors can creep up if getting next to a boundary of the whole map, so I made them all act as walls. I also had a lot of trouble debugging my NEWS directions, so I simplified the appraoch to make it easy to debug. Excited for the algorithms next!
